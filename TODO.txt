1. Determine if accuracy calculations are correct in evaluate or if bug in train.py.
2. Once results are confirmed run on citeseer, arxiv, ogbn_proteins and document results.
3. Aggregate the results from the partitions to possibly improve accuracy matching the
 original teacher model.
4. Now we have partitioned into subragphs, trained subgraph GNNs, distilled knowledge
from subgraph GNN teacher to subgraph GNN students, and aggregated the knowledge
from the partitions to preserve accuracy. This allows for distilled subgraph GNNs
on mobile or edge devices.
